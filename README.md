# Sudoku
This is a Sudoku game that I made.

It randomly generates puzzles that you can solve. To input just click on the tile you want to fill in and press the number.

I was challenged to make this by a school teacher. I wasn't challenged to make the application itself (that was just extra). I was challenged to create an algorithm that would solve any (solvable) sudoku puzzle. It took me a while but I did successfully create one. You can access this algorithm by pressing "g" on the keyboard and pressing "auto-fill" on the screen.
