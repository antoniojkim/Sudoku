# Sudoku
This is a Sudoku game that I devloped. I designed a graphical user interface that allows for input.

I also wrote a backtracking algorithm that is capable of solving any Sudoku Puzzle (so long as it has a solution). You can see the algorithm in action by first pressing "g" to make the feature available and giving it a puzzle to solve. You can slow down this process to see what the algorithm is actually doing by using the "show steps" slider.

The application utilizes the backtracking algorithm to randomly generate solvable Sudoku puzzles. Once a puzzle is generated you can input values to solve the puzzle. To input just click on the tile you want to fill in and press the number.
